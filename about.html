                </h3>
                <p>First and foremost, I love writing code. I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve problems. I always thought my dream was to be a Network engineer given my BE in Telecom (been there, done that). But I kind of just
                    felt 'me'. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different. And that's when the spark I was missing ignited the instance I played a python tutorial to manipulate data to produce desired result. Since then I can't get
                    enough.That fire carried me to pursue M.Tech with specialization in Machine learning where in I studied higher Mathematics & ML algorithms. Frontend web development calls it to my passion. It incorporates creativity and problem solving
                    and I am allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course ðŸ˜ƒ). I love applying responsive design principles and watch my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. Its peculiarly satisfying.
                    I am coachable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.</p>
